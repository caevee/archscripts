# Archscripts
These are my scripts for installing Arch and for installing my Openboxrice into a fresh Arch Install. Use at your own risk! It's recommended to try the install process in a VM before testing it on real hardware. Also do not use this script if you're not capable of installing Arch the way Archwiki recommends. 

# Usage
To use the scripts just run the script and follow the instructions.
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caevee/archscripts/master/archinstall.sh && sh archinstall.sh
```
